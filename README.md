This is a demonatration repository to show hosting a p5.js sketch on a github page. The Bouncing Ball sketch was previously developed by Evan Peck and Xiannong Meng. I have added the ability for the balls to collide, change colors on collision, and change speed on collison.

p5.js editor for this code: https://editor.p5js.org/mlg036/sketches/fFWgtWyrq
